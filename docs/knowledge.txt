knowledge about code:
1. sys.stdout.write() need fush, os.write() needn't.
2. '\b' can move cursor position, but the char still present.
3. '\r' in linux can move cursor to head of the line, and no new line.
4. if we want delete command line that already on console screen display, can use ' ' whitespace cover up. ???
