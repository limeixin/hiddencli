knowledge about code:
1. sys.stdout.write() need fush, os.write() needn't.
2. '\b' can move cursor position, but the char still present.
3. '\r' in linux can move cursor to head of the line, and no new line.
4. if we want delete command line that already on console screen display, can use ' ' whitespace cover up.
5. if move cursor to left, use print '\b', if move to right use print char
6. '^[' can not use for if '^[' == ch: , must use if ord(ch)==27:
